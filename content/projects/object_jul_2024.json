  "description": "An object tracking for robust human tracking application. The system fused the rgb image data with infrared image data to gain more robust object detection within the various lighting conditions. A kalman filter used to estimate the next position of the tracked human, and estimate the current position of a human that not detected in current frame. A deep learning model for appearance feature extraction was utilized. These appearance feature then used to associate a list of human in the previous frame with the current frame."
